            Autonomous vehicles and robotics represent a transformative frontier in modern engineering, integrating advancements in artificial intelligence, sensor technology, and real-time decision-making. This field aims to develop systems capable of perceiving their environment, processing complex data, and acting with minimal human intervention. Autonomous vehicles, including self-driving cars and drones, leverage technologies such as LiDAR, computer vision, and deep learning to navigate dynamic environments safely and efficiently. Similarly, autonomous robots are being employed across industries—from manufacturing and logistics to healthcare and exploration—enhancing productivity and enabling operations in hazardous or inaccessible areas. This abstract explores the core principles, current challenges, and future potential of autonomous systems, emphasizing their role in reshaping mobility, labor, and intelligent automation.
